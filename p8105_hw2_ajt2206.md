## Problem 2

**Reading and Cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel data**

Prior to importing the Mr. Trash Wheel data into R, I checked the excel
file. The “Year” column had an error where the numeric year was stored
as text. I converted the column data to numeric format within Excel
(Professor and Gwynnda already had these values stored as numeric).

``` r
mr_trash_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet= "Mr. Trash Wheel", range="A2:N549") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= weight_tons*500/30) |>
  mutate(homes_powered= round(homes_powered)) |> 
  mutate(wheel= "Mr. Trash Wheel") |> 
  select(wheel, everything())
```

To read-in and clean up the Mr. Trash Wheel data set, I performed the
following steps:

1.  Used the `readxl` to read in the data, restricting the sheet and
    rows to only Mr. Trash Wheel with data.

2.  `clean_names()` was used to make sure all the imported variables
    were consistently named

3.  I overwrote existing values in homes_powered using the equation
    found in Homes Powered Note in the original excel file.

4.  Because we are looking for an approximation of homes_powered, I
    rounded the values in homes_powered to the nearest whole number make
    the data more easily readable.

5.  I created a new variable “wheel” to help identify each trash wheel’s
    data once combined.

6.  Last, I re-ordered the data frame slightly to put the wheel variable
    first to simply make the rows more identifiable once combined as
    well.

**Reading and Cleaning the Professor and Gwynnda Trash Wheel Data**

``` r
prof_trash_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet= "Professor Trash Wheel", range="A2:M96") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= weight_tons*500/30) |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= round(homes_powered)) |>
  mutate(wheel= "Professor Trash Wheel") |> 
 select(wheel, everything())

gwynnda_trash_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet= "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range="A2:K108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= weight_tons*500/30) |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= round(homes_powered)) |>
  mutate(wheel= "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") |> 
 select(wheel, everything())
```

Same steps as described above for Mr. Trash Wheel data were repeated for
the Professor and Gwynnda Trash Wheels.

**Combining the three datasets**

``` r
triple_trash_df=
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df, prof_trash_df, gwynnda_trash_df)
```

**Description of the Data**

- This dataset provides data from May 2014 to August 2018 on the trash
  collected by three Trash Wheels situated in the Inner Harbor in
  Baltimore, Maryland.

- There are 747 observations and 16 variables within this dataset.

- The variables are as follows wheel, dumpster, month, year, date,
  weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls,
  homes_powered, plastic_bags.

- Key variables include the following. `wheel`: identifies which of the
  three trash wheels the row corresponds to. `weight_tons`: how much
  trash in tons in each dumpster. `homes_powered`: an estimation of how
  many Maryland homes are powered by the trash collected per dumpster.

- Total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel in tons.
  190.12

- Total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda is July of 2021:
  1.63^{4}

## Problem 3

``` r
mci_baseline_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/mci_baseline.xlsx", range="A2:F485") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sex= case_match(
      sex,
      0 ~ "Female",
      1 ~ "Male")
  ) |> 
  mutate(
   apoe4= case_match(
      apoe4,
      0 ~ "Non-carrier",
      1 ~ "Carrier")
  ) |> 
  filter(current_age != age_at_onset)
```

**Description of the import process and dataset**

482 participants met the inclusion criteria of the study and were
included in the data. One participant was excluded as they had mci at
Baseline. Of the 482 participants, 96 went on to develop mci. The
average baseline age is 65.043361 years old. 29.8578199 % of the women
in the study are APOE4 carriers.

``` r
mci_amyloid_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/mci_amyloid.xlsx", range="A2:F489") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  rename(id=study_id)
```

Similarly, import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally
observed biomarker values; comment on the steps on the import process
and the features of the dataset.

Check whether some participants appear in only the baseline or amyloid
datasets, and comment on your findings. Combine the demographic and
biomarker datasets so that only participants who appear in both datasets
are retained, and briefly describe the resulting dataset; export the
result as a CSV to your data directory

``` r
mci_combined_df=
  inner_join(mci_baseline_df, mci_amyloid_df, by= "id")
```
