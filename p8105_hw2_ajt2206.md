## Problem 2

**Reading and Cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel data**

Prior to importing the Mr. Trash Wheel data into R, I checked the excel
file. The “Year” column had an error where the numeric year was stored
as text. I converted the column data to numeric format within Excel
(Professor and Gwynnda already had these values stored as numeric).

``` r
mr_trash_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet= "Mr. Trash Wheel", range="A2:N549") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= weight_tons*500/30) |>
  mutate(homes_powered= round(homes_powered)) |> 
  mutate(wheel= "Mr. Trash Wheel") |> 
  select(wheel, everything())
```

To read-in and clean up the Mr. Trash Wheel data set, I performed the
following steps:

1.  Used the `readxl` to read in the data, restricting the sheet and
    rows to only Mr. Trash Wheel with data.

2.  `clean_names()` was used to make sure all the imported variables
    were consistently named

3.  I overwrote existing values in homes_powered using the equation
    found in Homes Powered Note in the original excel file.

4.  Because we are looking for an approximation of homes_powered, I
    rounded the values in homes_powered to the nearest whole number make
    the data more easily readable.

5.  I created a new variable “wheel” to help identify each trash wheel’s
    data once combined.

6.  Last, I re-ordered the data frame slightly to put the wheel variable
    first to simply make the rows more identifiable once combined as
    well.

**Reading and Cleaning the Professor and Gwynnda Trash Wheel Data**

``` r
prof_trash_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet= "Professor Trash Wheel", range="A2:M96") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= weight_tons*500/30) |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= round(homes_powered)) |>
  mutate(wheel= "Professor Trash Wheel") |> 
 select(wheel, everything())

gwynnda_trash_df=
  readxl::read_excel("data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet= "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range="A2:K108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= weight_tons*500/30) |> 
  mutate(homes_powered= round(homes_powered)) |>
  mutate(wheel= "Gwynnda Trash Wheel") |> 
 select(wheel, everything())
```

Same steps as described above for Mr. Trash Wheel data were repeated for
the Professor and Gwynnda Trash Wheels.

**Combining the three datasets**

``` r
triple_trash_df=
  bind_rows(mr_trash_df, prof_trash_df, gwynnda_trash_df)
```

**Description of the Data**

- This dataset provides data from May 2014 to August 2018 on the trash
  collected by three Trash Wheels situated in the Inner Harbor in
  Baltimore, Maryland.

- There are 747 observations and 16 variables within this dataset.

- The variables are as follows wheel, dumpster, month, year, date,
  weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
  cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls,
  homes_powered, plastic_bags.

- Key variables include the following. `wheel`: identifies which of the
  three trash wheels the row corresponds to. `weight_tons`: how much
  trash in tons in each dumpster. `homes_powered`: an estimation of how
  many Maryland homes are powered by the trash collected per dumpster.

- Total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is tons.
  `sum(prof_trash_df, weight_tons)`

- Total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda is July of 2021:
